# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This guide was designed to introduce some foundational level coding concepts around HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as prepare us for bootcamp by installing all the necessary applications and extensions to succeed in the course. I had to revisit code at times to debug it and decipher where the errors were. I learnt the basics of the coding languages and also became more familiar and comfortable with leveraging VS Code and working within the terminal.
